<h1>A rainy day problem</h1>

<p>by Charles Zheng

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>It has started to rain, and you forgot your umbrella.  Should you
run?  This question was posed by my classmates at Stanford.
Intuitively, it seems that you will minimize your exposure to the rain
by making your trip back home as short as possible.  On the other
hand, if you run very quickly, it seems plausible that you would start
"running into" more raindrops in a horizontal direction.  In the limit
of infinite speed, you will hit every raindrop that is currently
between you and your destination.  So, is there an "optimal" speed to
run, which is not infinite?  This is a puzzle suitable for a
introductory physics class.

<h2>A model</h2>

<p>Here is how I have decided to model the problem.  You are
represented modelled by a box with width <i>l</i> and height <i>h</i>
in a two-dimensional space.  The starting location is (0,0) and the
destination is (<i>d</i>,0).  The box moves at speed <i>v</i> until
the right edge of the box reaches <i>d</i>. Meanwhile, rain is hitting
the top edge and the right edge of the box.  The rain is considered to
be "uniformly distributed" in the two-dimensional space, and is
falling downwards with velocity <i>r</i>.

<h2>Solution</h2>

<p>Introduce the third dimension of time, <i>t</i>.  Let <i>T</i> be
the total time the box takes, (so <i>v = (d-l)/T</i>). Then we can
plot the trajectory of the box and the rain particles in a 3d plot:

<p>The top edge of the box traces out a parallelogram of length <i>l</i>
and height <i>T</i>, and normal vector (0,-1,0). The right edge of the
box traces out a parallelogram of length <i>L =
&radic;((d-l)<sup>2</sup> + T<sup>2</sup>)</i>, with normal
vector <i>(T,0,l-d)/L</i>.  In this three-dimensional space, the
rainfall can be represented as a vector field where the direction at
every point in the space is (0,-r,1).  Since we only care about the
relative amount of exposure to the rain, the global scaling of the
vector field does not matter.

<p>The total exposure to rain is equal to the total flux of the two
  parallelograms in this vector field.  The flux of the parallelogram
  traced out by the top edge is <i>rlT</i>. The flux of the
  parallelogram traced out by the right edge is <i>h(d-l)</i>. Hence
  the total flux is <i>lrT + h(d-l)</i>.  This is clearly minimized
  by <i>T=0</i>, which results in the minimum flux <i>h(d-l)</i>.
  Hence you should run as fast as possible.

<p>The reader can check that adding an <i>x</i> velocity component to
the rain (slanted rain) does not change the conclusion; nor does
adding a third spatial dimension.
