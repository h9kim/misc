\noindent\textbf{Analysis of Diffusion MRI data}\\

\\
Diffusion MRI (dMRI) is the only non-invasive method currently available to
measure the structure of the human white matter \emph{in vivo}. Human white
matter consists almost entirely of the nerve fibers that connect between
different parts of the brain, and that form the neural networks that support
human cognition and behavior. Scientists and clinicians use the resulting maps
of the white matter to assess connectivity between different parts of the brain
and also to clarify the relationship between properties of the tissues within
the white matter and cognition, both in healthy individuals and in cases where
cognition functions are damaged through disease.

The measurement relies on the application of directional magnetic field
gradients, which generates images that are attenuated in the locations in the
brain in which there is a high rate of diffusion along each gradient
direction. For example, in a location containing a large proportion of fibers
oriented along the right-left direction (approximately parallel to the line
connecting the participant's ears), the signal would be attentuated when the
diffusion gradient is applied along this direction, and would be high when a
gradient is applied along the front-back direction. The analysis of dMRI data
constructs models of the configuration of fibers at each location in the brain
(measured on the mm scale) and these models are then used as the basis for
tractography. 

Though several algorithms and models have been proposed over the years [Frank,
Tournier, Behrens, Dell'Acqua], a major problem in dMRI is the accurate
estimation of the directions and relative abundances of white matter tracts in
each measurement location. In particular, many of the methods require a prior
assumption about the number of fiber populations in every location, or strct
assumptions about the sparseness of the fiber orientation distribution
function. In this project, we developed methods to fit these models, without
strict assumptions of sparsesness, and methods to evaluate the models for their
accuracy and reliability.

The data we analyzed consists of a set of 10 non-diffusion weighted MRI images
that serve as a baseline ($S_0$) , and 150 dMRI images, each consisting of
$106\times 76 \times 81$ volumetric pixels, or voxels at a spatial resolution
of approximately 2x2x2 $mm^3$.  In a pre-processing step, we identify the
voxels which contain white matter.  Our goal is to infer the number $k$ of
distinct fiber populations located in each voxel, along with the
directions $v_1,\hdots,v_k$ and relative abundances $w_1,\hdots,w_k$.\\

\noindent\textbf{Current Work}

The 150 diffusion-weighted measurement direction, $x_1,\hdots,x_{150}$ are
spaced evenly on the unit sphere.  In a given voxel, let $y_1,\hdots,y_{150}$
denote the intensities of that voxel in each of the dMRI images.  The
statistical model we employ is a variation of the \emph{sparse fascicle model}
first proposed by Frank 2001.  Under this model, the signal measured in
direction $x_i$ is distributed by $y_i \sim Rician(S_0 \sum_{j=1}^k w_j
e^{-\kappa(v_j^T x_i)}, \sigma^2)$ where $S_0$ is the basline non-diffusion
weighted MRI signal, $\kappa$ is an unknown parameter produced from the
interaction of tissue properties and the measurement process, and $\sigma^2$ is a
noise parameter.  The Rician distribution as follows: for $X \sim Rician(\mu,\sigma^2)$,
we have $\frac{X^2}{\sigma^2} \sim \chi^2_2(\frac{\mu^2}{\sigma^2})$.

Existing approaches for estimating the directions and weights rely on
assumptions about the number of fibers.  We develop a method for
\emph{nonparametrically} estimating the fiber directions and weights
(Zheng 2014), which therefore makes no assumptions about the number of
fibers.  Our algorithm, elastic basis pursuit (EBP), finds the
directions $\hat{v}_1,\hdots,\hat{v}_{\hat{k}}$ and weights
$\hat{w}_1,\hdots,\hat{w}_{\hat{k}}$ which globally minimize the
residual sum of squares $\sum_{i=1}^{150}\left(y_i -
\sum_{j=1}^{\hat{k}} \hat{w}_j e^{-\kappa(\hat{v}_j^T x_i)}\right)^2$.
The algorithm proceeds in a forward stepwise manner: in each step, it
finds the fiber direction with the greatest correlation to the current
residual and adds that direction to the active set.  Then, the
coefficients, or weights, of each direction in the active set are
updated.  Due to a property of non-negative least squares, some of the
coefficients will become zero--the corresponding directions are then
pruned from the active set.  The algorithm grows and shrinks the
active set of directions as needed--hence the name, \emph{elastic
  basis pursuit}.  In contrast to similar existing approaches (Rokem
2013), our method does not employ discretization, resulting in more
accurate estimates (Figure 1.)\\

\noindent\textbf{Future Work}

One of the open problems in the DWI literature is estimating the
number of fiber populations in each voxel, especially in a
computationally] efficient manner.  We are developing an approach for
estimating the number of fibers by using the \emph{facility location
problem}.  

We begin with an estimated fiber orientation
distribution function (fODF) obtained from EBP: this estimated fODF
has directions $\hat{v}_1,\hdots,\hat{v}_{\hat{k}}$ and weights
$\hat{w}_1,\hdots,\hat{w}_{\hat{k}}$.  Generally, $\hat{k}$ is an
overestimate of the number of directions, because many
of the estimated directions occur in tightly concentrated clusters;
we would expect the number of fibers to correspond to the number of these clusters
rather than the number of directions.

This motivates the definition of effective sparsity.  Define the
arc-length distance $d_{arc}$ by $d_{arc}(v,w) = \cos^{-1}(|v'w|)$.
Choose a threshold paramter $\tau > 0$, then let $\ell$ be the
smallest number such that there exist prototypes $u_1,\hdots,u_\ell$
such that the total within-cluster distance is less than $\tau$, i.e.
\[
\sum_{i=1}^{\hat{k}} \hat{w}_i \min_{j=1}^\ell  d_{arc}(\hat{v}_i, u_j) < \tau
\]
Then the effective sparsity (under threshold $\tau$) is defined by the number $k$.

We propose to develop efficient algorithms for computing the effective
sparsity, borrowing from the literature on the uncapacitated facility
location (Jain, 2002).  Given a cost parameter $c$, a list of
estimated directions $v_1,\hdots,v_K$ and weights $w_1,\hdots,w_K$, as
well as a dense sampling on the half-sphere of possible 'facility
locations', or directions of fiber populations, $U \subset
\mathbb{RP}^2$, the Jain-Mahdian-Saberi algorithm finds the subset
$u_{1},\hdots,u_{m}$ which approximately optimizes
\begin{equation}\label{eq:flp}
\min_m \min_{u_{1},\hdots,u_{m}} cm + \sum_{i=1}^K w_i \min_l d_{arc}(v_i, u_{l})
\end{equation}
We make the
observation that by varying $c$ from 0 to $\frac{\pi}{2}$, one varies
the number $m$ from $\hat{k}$ to 1, and the total within-cluster distance  increases from zero to its maximum value.
We have tested this clustering approach in real data: the result can
be seen in
figure \ref{fig:bg}.  However, our current approach is computationally
inefficient, since it relies on solving the optimization problem
\eqref{eq:flp}
once for each cost value $c$ on a dense grid of cost values in
$[0,\pi/2]$,
resulting in redundant computation.
Therefore we propose to develop a \emph{homotopy algorithm} which
obtains the \emph{entire path of solutions} for cost parameter $c$ in
$[0,\pi/2]$ in a computationally efficient manner.
An illustration of the homotopy algorithm in the one-dimensional case
is presented in figure \ref{fig:homotopy}; however, we will apply the
algorithm in the spherical domain.
